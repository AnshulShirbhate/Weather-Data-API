# Weather-Data-API
This is a Weather Data API project which uses the open weather map's API.

To run this App, simply follow the following commands on your terminal:
(Note: "Github pages do not allow nodejs applications to run so this will not work here you have to run it locally to get it running.")
(Note: "You should have nodejs installed")
1. npm install
2. node app.js

After doing these steps as described, you can now go to your web browser(Chrome/Firefox/Edge) and type in the url bar "localhost:3000".

Congrats you can now access the app!
